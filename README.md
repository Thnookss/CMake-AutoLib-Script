# CMake-AutoLib-Script
Bash script which auto complete the CMakeLists.txt to link libraries of your choice.

Place the AutoLib.sh script in your project file, and open a bash in the directory.
modify the paths in the script to the path where your libraries are.
I advise to place your headers files and cpp files in two differents directories.
Run the script using ./AutoLib.sh command and put the library name in parameters.

ex : ./AutoLib.sh Mylib1 MyLib2 ...
